# ODAMV - Oda is Developing Another Mechanical Ventilator

Hello! Welcome to yet another open source ventilator project. 

Due to COVID-19, the world is facing shortages on personal protection utilities and medical equipment. Critically, life saving tools as ventilators are also in this shortage and there are many groups around the globe racing to produce affordable, open source solutions, that can be tested and deployed within the next weeks/months (this is being written on 31/03/2020).


## !!!WARNING!!!

**All the resources listed here are about medical devices and some of them are not even properly tested, due to the fact that their are designs under development. Please, if you are going to contribute/replicate to any of the projects listed, included this one, make sure you are completely aware that the lack of precaution and improper use can lead to serious and even potentially fatal consequences!!! Make sure you are advised by someone (or group of people) with medical knowledge! and that you are not breaking any laws/regulations while working with these projects**
